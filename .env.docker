# Example: -v /host/path/to/config:/app/config
#
# Required files in config directory (mounted volume):
#   - credentials.json    (OAuth client credentials from Google Cloud Console)
#   - token_account1.json (Generated after first auth - Account 1)
#   - token_account2.json (Generated after first auth - Account 2)
#   - sync.db             (SQLite database - auto-created)
#
# Note: OAuth credentials should be stored in the config directory
# as credentials.json, NOT in environment variables or this file.
